# Netflix Clone ðŸŽ¬ - Static Frontend Implementation

"This project is a dynamic web application built with Next.js, serving as an interface for a movie API. While visually inspired by the Netflix landing page, it goes beyond a static clone by fetching and displaying real-time movie data (like popular titles, genres, and details) from an external source. It leverages the power of Next.js and React to build an interactive user experience, serving as a practical exercise in API integration, state management, and component-based development within the Next.js framework."

## Technologies Used

This project is built using fundamental web technologies:

-   **HTML5**: Used for structuring the web page content semantically.
-   **CSS3**: Used for styling the user interface, layout, colors, and responsiveness. This includes techniques like:
    -   Flexbox and/or CSS Grid for layout management.
    -   Media Queries for creating a responsive design adapting to different screen sizes.
-   **JavaScript (Vanilla)**: Used for adding interactivity, primarily for the Frequently Asked Questions (FAQ) accordion functionality. No external frameworks or libraries (like React, Vue, jQuery) are used.

## Setup

Follow these simple steps to set up and view the project locally:

### 1. Clone the repository:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/Amrr-Maherr/Netflix-Clone.git
```

### 2. Navigate to the project directory:

```bash
cd Netflix-Clone
```

### 3. Open the project:

Simply open the `index.html` file in your preferred web browser (e.g., Chrome, Firefox, Safari, Edge). You can usually do this by double-clicking the file in your file explorer.

*   **(Alternative for Developers):** Use a live server extension (like "Live Server" in VS Code) to serve the `index.html` file, which provides auto-reloading upon code changes.

**Note:** No installation (`npm install`) or environment variables are needed as this is a static project.

## Features

-   **Visual Replication**: Mimics the look and feel of the Netflix landing page sections (Header, Hero, Feature Sections, FAQ, Footer).
-   **Semantic HTML**: Structured content using appropriate HTML5 tags.
-   **CSS Styling**: Custom CSS to match Netflix's design language and color palette.
-   **FAQ Accordion**: Interactive Frequently Asked Questions section where answers toggle open/close on click, powered by JavaScript.
-   **Static Site**: Runs entirely in the browser without needing a backend server or database.
-   **(Potentially) Responsive Design**: Adapts layout for different screen sizes (desktop, tablet, mobile) using CSS Media Queries. *(Verify if implemented)*

## Folder Structure

The project follows a basic static site structure:

```plaintext
.
â”œâ”€â”€ .gitignore          # Specifies intentionally untracked files that Git should ignore
â”œâ”€â”€ README.md           # This file, providing information about the project
â”œâ”€â”€ images/             # Contains all static image assets used in the project
â”‚   â”œâ”€â”€ background.jpg  # Example: Main background image
â”‚   â”œâ”€â”€ logo.png        # Example: Netflix logo
â”‚   â”œâ”€â”€ card-1.png     # Example: Images for feature sections
â”‚   â””â”€â”€ ...             # Other necessary images
â”œâ”€â”€ index.html         # The main HTML file containing the page structure
â”œâ”€â”€ script.js          # JavaScript file for interactive elements (e.g., FAQ)
â””â”€â”€ style.css          # CSS file for all styling rules
```

## How to Use

1.  Open the `index.html` file in your web browser as described in the [Setup](#setup) section.
2.  Scroll through the different sections of the cloned landing page.
3.  Interact with the "Frequently Asked Questions" section by clicking on a question to reveal or hide its answer.
